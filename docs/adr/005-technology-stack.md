# ADR 005 - Technology stack

Date: 26-11-2024

## Status

Accepted

Written years after the decision was made.

## Context

We want to create a stack that is simple and could potentially be set up on a simple hosting setup.

We need a technology stack for the project.

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/) provides a modern programming language with easy hosting options.
* [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) is one of the biggest PHP frameworks for creating web projects.
* [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) is PHP framework for creating APIs.
* [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is a standard for describing an API interface.
* [React](https://react.dev/) is one of the biggest UI frameworks.

## Decision

We will use PHP, Symfony and API Platform as the main technologies for the API.

We will use OpenAPI for API specification.

We will use React for writing the clients and templates.

## Consequences
