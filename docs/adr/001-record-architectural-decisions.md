# ADR 001 - Record architectural decisions

Date: 26-11-2024

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Architectural Decision Records as
[described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) provides a
framework for writing down these decisions.

The project has been running for several years and there is a need for summarizing some of the baselines of the project,
to document the original ideas and decisions.

## Decision

We will use Architectural Decision Records.

We will write down the original architectural decisions as ADRs even though years have passed, to help document the
thoughts behind the project.

## Consequences

This introduces an additional burden on core project maintainers to diligently follow architecture discussions and
record the decisions in this repo as an ADR.
